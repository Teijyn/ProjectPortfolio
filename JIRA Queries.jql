## ðŸ“Œ Tesla JIRA JQL Query Collection

**Goal**  
To demonstrate effective use of JIRA Query Language (JQL) to support project tracking, issue resolution, and Agile operations within a real-time Tesla manufacturing environment.

**Description**  
This collection includes beginner to advanced JQL examples that reflect real-world use cases in manufacturing production, tooling deployments, sprint management, and quality control tracking. These queries can power dashboards, filter boards, and status reports for engineering and operations teams.


### ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level Queries


-- All open tickets in a specific project
project = "Model Y Tooling" AND status = "Open"

-- Tasks assigned to a specific team member
assignee = jpham AND status != Done

-- Issues created this week
created >= startOfWeek()

-- Tasks related to torque tool integration
summary ~ "torque" OR description ~ "torque"

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level Queries


-- Tickets related to production downtime over past 7 days
project = "Production Support" AND labels = downtime AND created >= -7d

-- Open bugs affecting final assembly line
project = "Model 3 Assembly" AND issuetype = Bug AND status in ("Open", "In Progress") AND component = "Final Line"

-- User stories not assigned to any sprint
project = "Powertrain Ops" AND issuetype = Story AND sprint is EMPTY

-- Issues with attachments (e.g. logs or screenshots)
attachments is not EMPTY AND created >= -30d

-- Tickets reopened more than once
status changed TO Reopened BY currentUser() AFTER -30d


ðŸ”´ Advanced Level Queries


-- Blocker issues on tooling projects created in last 14 days
project in ("Tooling Integration", "Torque Deployment") AND priority = Blocker AND created >= -14d

-- Epics with linked stories still unresolved (requires ScriptRunner)
issuetype = Epic AND issueFunction in linkedIssuesOf("status != Done", "epic link")

-- Custom field-based query (Production Line 5, Night Shift)
"Production Line" = "Line 5" AND "Shift" = "Night" AND status != Closed

-- Sprint burndown: Remaining stories in current sprint
sprint in openSprints() AND issuetype = Story AND resolution = Unresolved

-- Tickets labeled 'hotfix' linked to release issues
issueLinkType = "relates to" AND labels in (hotfix) AND project = "Firmware Rollout"
